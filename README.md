# Plant-disease-recognition
Developed a robust plant disease recognition system leveraging deep learning and machine learning techniques. Utilized a dataset of plant images to classify various diseases.

### Steps Involved:

1. Preprocessed the data using normalization and augmentation techniques.
2. Extracted features using the MobileNetV2 model.
3. Applied feature selection with SelectKBest.
4. Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for accurate disease classification.
